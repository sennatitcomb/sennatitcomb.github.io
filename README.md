What's the purpose of the project?

What problem does it solve for various audiences? A case study is great if you have one.
Why is the project/product better than the competition? (e.g., value proposition)
Where can I find help? Where's the documentation? 
Whom can I contact to learn more (or how)? 
Where/how can I download/run/use what's being offered?
What's the repository (if any)?
