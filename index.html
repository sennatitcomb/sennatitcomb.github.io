                </li>
                <p>In this project, I helped conceptualize and create a telemetry data visualization platform for Intel. This was a comprehensive SaaS observability solution designed to empower Intel engineers with real-time insights into their cloud-native workloads. From initialization to production, this project entailed architecting and developing a cutting-edge platform that revolutionized how telemetry data is harnessed and leveraged for Intel's benefit.
